## ‚úÖ WHAT YOU HAD ALREADY DONE (3 items)

### 1. Rate Limiting Infrastructure (#8) ‚úÖ

**What existed:**
- Complete Vercel KV rate limiting in `lib/rateLimitKv.ts`
- Used in all major API routes (process-image, roast, canvas, etc.)

- Graceful degradation when KV not configured

**What we did:**
- Verified implementation is production-ready

- Documented activation steps

**Action required:** Just add Vercel KV env vars to activate

---

### 2. Database Consolidation (#12) ‚úÖ

**What existed:**
