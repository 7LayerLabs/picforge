## Known Issues (Pre-Existing)

### Not Blocking Deployment:
1. **Environment Variables** - Stripe webhook secret needs configuration
   - Status: Pre-existing issue, not related to batch UX changes
   - Impact: Build fails but dev server works fine
   - Solution: Set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env.local

2. **InstantDB App ID** - Required for authentication
   - Status: Pre-existing missing env var
   - Impact: Auth features won't work
   - Solution: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID in .env.local

### New Issues:
- None identified. All TypeScript errors resolved.

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Review
- [x] All new components use TypeScript ✓
- [x] ESLint compliant (no warnings) ✓
- [x] No console.log statements in production code ✓
- [x] Proper error handling ✓
- [x] Consistent code style ✓

### 2. Local Testing
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to /batch
# Test all functionality from checklist above
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx next build

# Expected: Build succeeds until environment variable check
# This is acceptable - our code is valid
```

### 4. Git Commit
```bash
git add components/BatchQuickStart.tsx
git add components/BatchProgressBar.tsx
git add components/EffectLibrary.tsx
git add app/batch/page.tsx
git add components/roulette/RouletteShareModal.tsx
git add BATCH_UX_IMPROVEMENTS.md

### 5. Push to Repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 6. Vercel Deployment
- Vercel will auto-deploy from main branch
- Monitor deployment logs for any issues
- Estimated deployment time: 2-3 minutes

### 7. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Visit https://pic-forge.com/batch
- [ ] Test quick start guide expansion
- [ ] Upload test images

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

### Quick Rollback (if critical bug)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Selective Rollback (if specific component fails)
```bash
# Revert just the batch page changes
git checkout HEAD~1 app/batch/page.tsx
git commit -m "Rollback batch page changes"
git push origin main
```

### Full Rollback (if major issues)
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

## Monitoring Post-Deployment

### User Metrics to Track (Week 1)
- Batch processing completion rate
- Average effects per batch
- Quick Start Guide open rate
- Effect category expansion rate
- Time to first batch process
- Error rate during processing

### Analytics Events to Add (Future)
```javascript
// Track effect clicks
analytics.track('Effect Clicked', {
  effect: 'warm',
  category: 'Color Adjustments',
  totalEffects: 3
})

// Track guide usage
analytics.track('Quick Start Opened', {
  pageLoadTime: 2.3
})

// Track batch completion
analytics.track('Batch Completed', {
  imageCount: 10,
  effectsUsed: 'warm vignette grain',
  processingTime: 45
})
```

### User Feedback Collection
- Monitor support tickets for confusion
- Check social media for user reactions

## Support Documentation

### Common User Questions

**Q: How do I combine effects?**
A: Click multiple effects from the library, or type them separated by spaces. Example: "warm sharpen vignette"

**Q: What order should effects be in?**
A: Order matters! "grayscale contrast" applies grayscale first, then boosts contrast. Try different orders to see what looks best.

**Q: Why isn't my batch processing?**
A: Make sure you've:
1. Uploaded images (drag & drop or click)
2. Added at least one effect
3. Clicked "Start Processing"

**Q: Can I pause processing?**
A: Yes! Click "Pause" or press ESC. Click "Resume" to continue.

**Q: How long will processing take?**
A: The progress bar shows estimated time remaining based on current speed. Usually 10-20 seconds per image.

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue: Effects not adding to prompt**
- Solution: Click directly on the effect name/icon, not the whitespace around it

**Issue: Progress bar not showing**
- Solution: Make sure images are uploaded first. Progress bar only appears when images are loaded.

**Issue: Time estimates are wrong**
- Solution: Estimates improve after 2-3 images complete. Initial estimates may be inaccurate.

**Issue: Can't scroll to see all effects**
- Solution: Effects are in collapsible categories. Expand each category to see all effects.
