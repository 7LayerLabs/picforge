1. Assess impact (can we launch without it?)
2. Fix within 24 hours
3. Monitor closely post-launch

**Medium/Low Failure (Performance, Browser Edge Cases):**
1. Document known issues
2. Launch with warnings
3. Fix in next sprint

---

### If Issues Found Post-Launch

**Critical (Payments Down, Security Breach):**
1. Rollback immediately (`git revert HEAD && git push origin main --force`)
2. Clear Vercel cache
3. Notify users via status page
4. Fix before re-deploying

**High (Emails Not Sending, Analytics Not Tracking):**
1. Investigate logs
2. Deploy hotfix within 2 hours
3. Verify fix with tests

**Medium/Low (Performance Degradation, UI Bugs):**
1. Create GitHub issue
2. Schedule fix in next sprint
3. Monitor for escalation

## Closing Notes

Derek,

This testing framework is designed to give you **complete confidence** before launching PicForge.com publicly. Every critical system has been accounted for:

- **5 agents working in parallel?** ✅ This framework tests ALL their work
- **Security fixes?** ✅ Comprehensive security audit
- **Rate limiting?** ✅ 500/day/IP tested thoroughly
- **Stripe payments?** ✅ Full checkout flow verified
- **Email delivery?** ✅ All 4 templates tested
- **Analytics tracking?** ✅ Every event confirmed

The framework is **thorough but efficient**. You can run all automated tests in 30 minutes. The manual tests take longer (3-4 hours total) but ensure everything works together in real-world scenarios.

**Most importantly:** The framework tells you exactly when you're ready to launch. If all critical tests pass, you can push that button with confidence. If any fail, you know exactly what to fix.

Good luck with the launch! 🚀
