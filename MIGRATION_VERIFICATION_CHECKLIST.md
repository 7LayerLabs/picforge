## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. InstantDB schema covered all use cases
2. Real-time sync "just worked"
3. Migration completed without downtime
4. No data loss occurred
5. Build times improved
6. Codebase simplified significantly

### What Could Be Improved
1. Earlier migration planning (waited too long)
2. Better documentation of data relationships
3. More automated testing before migration
4. Performance benchmarking before/after

### Best Practices Identified
1. Use single database from start
2. Choose real-time DB for modern apps
3. Client-side DB reduces backend complexity
4. Magic links better UX than passwords
5. Offline sync valuable for users
