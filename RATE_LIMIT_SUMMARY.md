# Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✓ Code is ready, waiting for Vercel KV configuration
**Priority:** CRITICAL - API is currently unprotected
**Time to Fix:** 15 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

### The Problem

Your PicForge APIs are currently **UNPROTECTED** against abuse. The rate limiting code exists but is disabled because Vercel KV is not configured.

**Current Risk:**
- Attackers can make unlimited requests to your AI APIs
- Gemini API: $0.0025-$0.0125 per image
- Replicate API: $0.023 per NSFW image
- OpenAI DALL-E: $0.040-$0.080 per image
- **Potential monthly cost if attacked: $10,000+**

### The Solution

Configure Vercel KV (Redis database) to enable IP-based rate limiting:
- 500 requests/day per IP for main editor
- 200 requests/day per IP for NSFW editor
- 100 requests/day per IP for canvas generator
- Automatic 24-hour resets
- **Protected monthly cost: $50-$200**

   - Configuration validation
   - Local and production testing

### What You Need to Do (15 minutes)

**Only 1 thing:** Configure Vercel KV environment variables

**Step 1:** Create KV database in Vercel Dashboard (5 min)
**Step 2:** Add 4 environment variables to Vercel (5 min)
**Step 3:** Redeploy (2 min)
**Step 4:** Verify it's working (3 min)

That's it! The code handles everything else automatically.

---

## Environment Variables Needed

You need to add these 4 variables to Vercel:

```env
KV_URL=redis://...
KV_REST_API_URL=https://...
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=...
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=...
```

**Where to get them:**
Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Create KV Database → Copy connection strings

**Where to add them:**
Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Important:** Enable for ALL THREE environments:
- ✓ Production
- ✓ Preview
- ✓ Development

---

## Verification Checklist

After setup, verify everything works:

- [ ] Vercel KV database created and active
- [ ] 4 environment variables added to Vercel
- [ ] Application redeployed successfully
- [ ] Production logs show rate limit checks (not warnings)
- [ ] Test script passes: `npm run test:rate-limit`
- [ ] KV usage dashboard shows increasing commands
- [ ] Test API request on pic-forge.com and check logs

---

## Rate Limiting Behavior

### Normal User Experience

**User makes 1st request:**
- ✓ Request succeeds
- Response includes headers:
  ```
  X-RateLimit-Limit: 500
  X-RateLimit-Remaining: 499
  X-RateLimit-Reset: 1738291200000
  ```

**User makes 499th request:**
- ✓ Request succeeds
- Remaining: 1

**User makes 500th request:**
- ✓ Request succeeds
- Remaining: 0

**User makes 501st request:**
- ✗ Request blocked (HTTP 429)
- Error message: "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
- Headers show reset time

**After 24 hours:**
- Counter automatically resets
- User gets fresh 500 requests

### Attacker Scenario (Prevented)

**Before rate limiting:**
1. Attacker finds your API endpoint
2. Writes script to call it 10,000 times
3. You get charged $250-$800
4. Repeat daily = $7,500-$24,000/month

**With rate limiting:**
1. Attacker finds your API endpoint
2. Makes 500 requests successfully
3. Gets blocked with 429 error
4. Cost to you: $1.25-$6.25 per day
5. Monthly cost: $37.50-$187.50 (safe!)

---

## Cost Analysis

### Vercel KV Pricing
- **Free tier:** 30,000 commands/month
- **Beyond free:** $0.25 per 100,000 commands
- **PicForge usage:** ~10,000-30,000 commands/month
- **Your cost:** $0-$1/month (within free tier!)

### API Protection Value
- **Unprotected risk:** $10,000+ per month
- **Protected cost:** $50-$200 per month
- **Savings:** $9,800+ per month
- **ROI of $1 KV cost:** 980,000%

### Real Usage Estimate
If you have 100 active users/day:
- 100 users × 10 requests/user = 1,000 requests/day
- 1,000 × 30 days = 30,000 requests/month
- Well within free tier limits!

If you grow to 1,000 users/day:
- 1,000 users × 10 requests = 10,000 requests/day
- 10,000 × 30 = 300,000 requests/month
- Cost: (300k - 30k) / 100k × $0.25 = $0.68/month

**Bottom line:** KV is effectively free for your scale.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Request comes in** to API endpoint (e.g., `/api/process-image`)

2. **IP extraction:**
   ```typescript
   const identifier = getClientIdentifier(request)
   // Returns: "ip:123.456.789.000"
   ```

3. **Rate limit check:**
   ```typescript
   const rateLimit = await checkRateLimitKv(identifier, 500, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
   // Checks Redis for key: rate-limit:ip:123.456.789.000
   ```

4. **Counter increment:**
   - First request: Sets key to 1, sets 24-hour expiration
   - Subsequent requests: Increments counter
   - After 24 hours: Key automatically deleted (reset)

5. **Decision:**
   ```typescript
   if (!rateLimit.allowed) {
     return 429 error with reset time
   }
   // Continue with API logic
   ```

6. **Headers sent back:**
   ```
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 500
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 499
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1738291200000
   ```

### Fail-Open Design

Important safety feature:
```typescript
if (!process.env.KV_REST_API_URL) {
  console.warn('⚠️  Vercel KV not configured. Rate limiting disabled.')
  return { allowed: true, remaining: maxRequests, ... }
}
```

**Why fail-open:**
- Prevents breaking the app if KV goes down
- Allows testing without KV configured
- You see clear warnings in logs

**Trade-off:**
- Without KV, no rate limiting = vulnerable to abuse
- **That's why configuring KV is CRITICAL**

### Multiple IP Detection

The code checks multiple headers for maximum compatibility:
```typescript
const forwardedFor = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for')  // Vercel, AWS
const realIp = request.headers.get('x-real-ip')               // Nginx
const cfConnectingIp = request.headers.get('cf-connecting-ip') // Cloudflare

const ip = forwardedFor?.split(',')[0] || realIp || cfConnectingIp || 'unknown'
```

**On Vercel:** Uses `x-forwarded-for` (always present)

### Immediate (Do Today - 15 minutes)

1. **Read Quick Start:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/RATE_LIMIT_QUICKSTART.md
   ```

2. **Create Vercel KV Database:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores
   - Create new KV database named `picforge-rate-limit`

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Copy 4 KV connection strings
   - Add to Vercel project settings
   - Enable for Production, Preview, Development

4. **Redeploy:**

   ```

### This Week (Optional)

1. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Check Vercel logs daily for rate limit warnings
   - Monitor KV usage dashboard
   - Watch for any 429 errors from legitimate users

2. **Add to .env.local (for local development):**
   - Copy same 4 KV variables to `.env.local`
   - Test locally: `npm run test:rate-limit`

3. **Document for Users:**
   - Add rate limit info to your Help/FAQ page
   - Explain what users see if they hit the limit
   - Provide your email for limit increase requests

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Build page to view top IPs by request count
   - Manual rate limit resets
   - Whitelist/blacklist IP addresses

2. **User-Based Limits (Instead of IP):**
   - Use InstantDB user ID instead of IP
   - Different limits per tier (Free vs Pro)
   - Carry over unused requests

3. **Smart Limits:**
   - Decrease limit if detecting abuse patterns
   - Increase limit for verified users
   - Time-of-day based limits

4. **Monitoring Alerts:**
   - Vercel alert when 429 rate > 5%
   - Daily digest of top rate-limited IPs
   - Cost alerts if API usage spikes

## Questions?

**Q: What if I want higher limits?**
A: Edit the limit numbers in API route files, commit, and push. See `docs/VERCEL_KV_SETUP.md` section "Adjusting Rate Limits."

**Q: Can I bypass rate limiting for my own IP?**
A: Yes! See `docs/VERCEL_KV_SETUP.md` section "IP Address Bypass."

**Q: What if Vercel KV goes down?**
A: The code fails-open (allows requests) so your app stays functional. You'll see warnings in logs.

**Q: How much will KV cost at scale?**
A: At 10,000 users/day: ~$0.68/month. At 100,000 users/day: ~$6.80/month. Basically free.

**Q: Can attackers bypass IP-based rate limiting?**
A: They'd need 500+ different IP addresses per day. Unlikely but possible. Future enhancement: add user-based limits.

**Q: Do Pro/Unlimited tier users bypass rate limits?**
A: Currently no - rate limits apply to all IPs equally. Future enhancement: check user tier before rate limiting.
