## Technical Implementation

### **Access Check Logic:**

```typescript
const { user } = db.useAuth()

const { data: usageData } = db.useQuery(
  user ? { usage: { $: { where: { userId: user.id } } } } : null
)

const usage = usageData?.usage?.[0]
const isPro = usage?.tier === 'pro' || usage?.tier === 'unlimited'
const isAuthenticated = !!user
```

### **Conditional Rendering:**

```typescript
{isOpen && !isPro && renderPaywall()}
{isOpen && isPro && (
  // Full chat interface
)}
```

### **Event Listeners:**

Image context detection only activates for Pro users:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isPro) return // Don't listen if not Pro

  const handleImageUpload = async (event: Event) => {
    // ... analysis logic
  }

  window.addEventListener('imageUploaded', handleImageUpload)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('imageUploaded', handleImageUpload)
}, [isPro])
```

## Revenue Justification

### **Why Make It Pro-Only:**

1. **High API Costs:**
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$0.014 per chat
   - Gemini Vision: ~$0.001 per image analysis
   - Combined: ~$0.015 per interaction
   - At scale: 1,000 free users × 10 chats = $150/month in costs

2. **Premium Value:**
   - No other tool offers conversational prompt assistance
   - Context detection is cutting-edge
   - One-click insertion saves massive time
   - This feature alone justifies Pro pricing

3. **Conversion Driver:**
   - Free users see clear value proposition
   - "Try before you buy" with paywall preview
   - Encourages upgrades and promo code redemptions

4. **Differentiation:**
   - Competitors don't have this
   - Sticky feature that reduces churn
   - Pro users get continuous value

## Cost Analysis (Updated)

### **Revenue Impact:**

**Scenario: 1,000 users**
- Free: 800 users (see paywall, 5% convert = 40 new Pro users)
- Pro: 200 users (80% try chat = 160 active users)

**Costs:**
- 160 Pro users × 10 chats/month × $0.015 = $24/month
- Image analysis: 160 users × 5 images × $0.001 = $0.80/month
- **Total API cost: ~$25/month**

**Revenue:**
- 40 new conversions × $20/month = $800/month new MRR
- **Net benefit: $775/month** (from this feature alone)

**ROI:** 31x return on API costs

## Conclusion

Making the AI Prompt Assistant a **Pro-only feature** is the right move because:

1. **High API costs** justify premium pricing
2. **Premium value** - nobody else has this
3. **Strong conversion driver** for free → Pro upgrades
4. **Sticky feature** that reduces Pro churn
5. **Scalable** - costs grow linearly with Pro users (who pay)

Free users get a taste of what's possible, Pro users get incredible value, and you build a sustainable business model.
