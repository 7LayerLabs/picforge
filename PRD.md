## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical
- [ ] **Should we migrate rate limiting to Redis/DB for horizontal scaling?**
  - Current: In-memory (doesn't scale across multiple servers)
  - Impact: High if traffic spikes
  - Decision deadline: Before significant growth

- [ ] **Which authentication provider should we use?**
  - Options: NextAuth.js, Clerk, Supabase Auth, Auth0
  - Considerations: Cost, ease of integration, social login support
  - Decision deadline: Q1 2026 (before monetization)

- [ ] **Should we build a native mobile app or optimize PWA?**
  - PWA pros: Single codebase, instant updates
  - Native pros: Better performance, App Store discovery
  - Decision deadline: Q3 2026

### Business
- [ ] **What age verification system for 18+ content?**
  - Options: Third-party (Yoti, Jumio), credit card verification, government ID upload
  - Considerations: Cost, user friction, legal compliance
  - Decision deadline: Before Q1 2026 launch

- [ ] **Should we allow user-uploaded templates for revenue share?**
  - Pros: More content, community engagement, passive income
  - Cons: Moderation required, quality control, copyright issues
  - Decision deadline: Q2 2026

- [ ] **Enterprise pricing strategy?**
  - API access at $99/month sufficient?
  - White-label pricing model?
  - Decision deadline: Q3 2026

### Product
- [ ] **Should free tier have watermarks?**
  - Pros: Viral marketing, premium differentiation
  - Cons: User friction, may reduce sharing
  - Decision deadline: Before monetization launch

- [ ] **What happens to existing users when we add auth?**
  - Grandfather in unlimited free access?
  - Require migration to free tier limits?
  - Decision deadline: Q2 2026

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

**üî¥ API Cost Overruns**
- Risk: Viral growth without monetization could bankrupt project
- Likelihood: Medium (if featured on Product Hunt, Reddit, etc.)
- Impact: High (project shutdown)
- Mitigation:
  - Current rate limiting (500/day)
  - Monitor daily costs closely
  - Emergency killswitch for free tier
  - Accelerate monetization if traffic spikes

**üî¥ Legal Issues with NSFW Content**
- Risk: Hosting/generating illegal content, DMCA takedowns
- Likelihood: Medium (any platform with NSFW features faces this)
- Impact: High (liability, platform bans)
- Mitigation:
  - Age verification required
  - Clear Terms of Service and disclaimers
  - No content storage (ephemeral only)
  - Legal review before 18+ launch
  - Content moderation tools

### Medium Risk

**üü° AI Provider Changes**
- Risk: Gemini API price increases or policy changes
- Likelihood: Medium (Google has changed pricing before)
- Impact: Medium (need to migrate or raise prices)
- Mitigation:
  - Multi-provider architecture already in place
  - Can switch to Replicate, OpenAI, or others
  - Monitor provider announcements

**üü° Competition from Big Tech**
- Risk: Adobe/Canva copy core features
- Likelihood: High (already happening with Generative Fill)
- Impact: Medium (harder to differentiate, pricing pressure)
- Mitigation:
  - Move fast, innovate constantly
  - Build community and brand loyalty
  - Focus on niche use cases (gamification, batch)

### Low Risk

**üü¢ Technical Scalability**
- Risk: Site crashes under high load
- Likelihood: Low (Vercel scales automatically)
- Impact: Medium (lost users, bad reputation)
- Mitigation:
  - Already on Vercel (handles spikes well)
  - Client-side processing reduces server load
  - Can add caching/CDN as needed
