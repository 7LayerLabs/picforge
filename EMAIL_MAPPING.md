# PicForge Email Addresses

This document maps all PicForge email addresses to their purposes and where they're used in the codebase.

---

## üìß Email Directory

### 1. **no-reply@pic-forge.com**
**Purpose:** Automated emails that don't require user replies
**Used For:**
- Welcome emails
- Daily limit warnings
- Promo code redemption confirmations
- Pro upgrade notifications
- Weekly digests

**Code Locations:**
- `lib/email.ts` (line 115) - Resend "from" address
- All email templates inherit this from the email service

**Why no-reply?** This is standard practice for transactional emails. Users can still manage preferences or contact support, but replies to automated emails go nowhere to avoid cluttering support inbox.

---

### 2. **support@pic-forge.com**
**Purpose:** Customer support and help requests
**Used For:**
- Bug reports
- General questions
- Technical support
- Feature requests
- User feedback

**Code Locations:**
- `app/contact/page.tsx` (lines 22, 37) - Contact form mailto
- `app/legal/privacy/page.tsx` (line 667) - Privacy policy support link
- `app/legal/terms/page.tsx` (line 716) - Terms support link
- `app/unsubscribe/page.tsx` (line 199) - Unsubscribe feedback link

**Email Flow:**
User ‚Üí Contact Form ‚Üí Opens email client ‚Üí support@pic-forge.com

---

### 3. **hello@pic-forge.com**
**Purpose:** General inquiries, partnerships, and marketing connections
**Used For:**
- Business inquiries
- Partnership requests
- Media inquiries
- General questions from non-users
- Marketing outreach

**Code Locations:**
- `components/Footer.tsx` (line 74) - Footer contact email

**Why separate from support?** This keeps business/partnership emails separate from customer support tickets, allowing you to prioritize differently.

---

### 4. **showcase@pic-forge.com**
**Purpose:** User submissions for the Showcase gallery
**Used For:**
- Showcase transformations submissions
- Before/after image submissions
- User-created content for gallery

**Code Locations:**
- `app/submit/page.tsx` (line 22) - Submit creation form mailto

**Email Flow:**
User ‚Üí Submit Form ‚Üí Opens email client with pre-filled message ‚Üí showcase@pic-forge.com ‚Üí User attaches images ‚Üí Sends

**Note:** Users submit their creations via email with attachments. You can review and add to showcase manually.

---

### 5. **derek@pic-forge.com**
**Purpose:** Derek's personal email for PicForge, legal/privacy inquiries
**Used For:**
- Privacy requests (GDPR/CCPA)
- Legal inquiries
- Data protection contact
- EU representative contact
- Official business communications

**Code Locations:**
- `app/legal/privacy/page.tsx` (lines 616, 629) - Data protection contact
- `app/legal/terms/page.tsx` (line 676) - Terms contact

**Why separate?** Legal and privacy requests require specific handling and may have regulatory deadlines (30-45 days). This ensures they don't get lost in general support emails.

## üîß Email Setup Requirements

### For Resend (Transactional Emails)
All 5 email addresses need to be added to your Resend domain verification:

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add domain: `pic-forge.com`
3. Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
4. Verify domain
5. All emails (@pic-forge.com) will work once domain is verified

**DNS Records Needed:**
```
Type  | Name                    | Value
------|-------------------------|----------------------------------
TXT   | pic-forge.com           | v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TXT   | resend._domainkey       | [Resend will provide this]
TXT   | _dmarc                  | v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:derek@pic-forge.com
```

### For Receiving Emails
You'll need an email hosting service to *receive* emails at these addresses. Options:

**Option 1: Google Workspace (Recommended)**
- $6/user/month
- Professional, reliable
- Derek already familiar with Gmail
- Setup: Add pic-forge.com domain, create 5 email accounts

**Option 2: Microsoft 365**
- $6/user/month
- Similar to Google Workspace

**Option 3: Cloudflare Email Routing (Free!)**
- Route to existing email (e.g., derek.bobola@gmail.com)
- Free for up to 200 addresses
- Good for forwarding, not sending
- Setup guide: https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/

**Option 4: Zoho Mail (Cheap)**
- $1/user/month
- Good for small teams

## üéØ Recommended Setup (Cloudflare Free)

   - `derek@pic-forge.com` ‚Üí `derek.bobola@gmail.com` (labeled "Legal")

**Q: Can users reply to no-reply emails?**

A: Gmail handles attachments fine. You'll see them in your forwarded email.

**Q: Can I respond *from* support@pic-forge.com in Gmail?**
A: Not with basic forwarding. You'd need Google Workspace or Gmail SMTP setup.

**Q: How do I avoid confusion between emails?**
A: Use Gmail labels and filters (see above). Each email type auto-labels.

**Q: What about spam?**
A: Cloudflare Email Routing has built-in spam filtering. Plus, all PicForge emails go through contact forms (not public addresses), reducing spam risk.
