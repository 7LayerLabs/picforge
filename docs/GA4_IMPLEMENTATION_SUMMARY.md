## What Was Implemented

### 1. GDPR-Compliant Cookie Consent Banner ✅

- Privacy-first messaging (no ads, no data selling)
- Matches PicForge brand (black/white/teal, clean design)
- Mobile-responsive

**User Flow:**
1. First visit → Banner appears at bottom
2. User accepts → GA4 loads, localStorage = `"accepted"`
3. User declines → GA4 blocked, localStorage = `"declined"`
4. Future visits → Banner doesn't show (choice remembered)
