## 🎨 FRONTEND & UX ISSUES

### Critical UX Problems

#### 1. Homepage - Prompt Count Discrepancy ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** High
**Location:** Multiple files
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Dec 2025)

~~- Homepage says "325+ prompts"~~
~~- Prompts page shows "272+ Prompts"~~
~~- Layout.tsx metadata says "210+ AI templates"~~

**Resolution:** All counts synchronized to **272+ prompts** across entire site
- Commit: `03bb44b` - "Sync all prompt counts to accurate 272+ across codebase"
- Files updated: `app/page.tsx`, `app/prompts/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/tips/page.tsx`

---

#### 2. Search Functionality Missing
**Severity:** High
**Location:** `/prompts` page

- Prompts library has 272+ prompts with 100+ tags
- No search bar - users must scroll through extensive tag lists
- Dense tag display overwhelms users

**Impact:** Poor discoverability, users can't find prompts quickly
**Fix:** Add search-first approach with autocomplete
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Add to app/prompts/page.tsx
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('')
const filteredPrompts = prompts.filter(p =>
  p.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  p.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  p.tags.some(t => t.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()))
)
```

---

#### 3. Batch Processing - Unclear Interface
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** `/batch` page

**Problems:**
- "0/0 processed" header is confusing
- Effect combinations lack documentation
- No visual previews of what effects do
- Terms like "warm vignette" lack explanation

**Impact:** Users don't understand how to use batch features
**Fix:**
- Add tooltips explaining each effect
- Preview thumbnails showing effect results
- Clearer progress indicators: "3 of 10 images processed"
- Effect combinations guide with examples

---

#### 4. Transform Roulette - Minimal Engagement
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** `/roulette` page

**Problems:**
- Core gamification works but lacks viral mechanics
- No social proof or leaderboard
- Missing share integration
- No streak tracking or achievements

**Impact:** Limited viral potential, low repeat engagement
**Fix:**
- Add one-click social sharing
- Implement streak/achievement system
- Create leaderboard for "most chaotic" transformations
- Progressive reveals to build anticipation
- Rare/jackpot transformations that feel special

---

#### 5. Mobile Responsiveness Concerns
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** Site-wide

**Problems:**
- Dense tag displays may challenge smaller screens
- No visible mobile optimization testing in code
- Prompts library not mobile-first

**Impact:** Poor mobile UX (50%+ of traffic is mobile)
**Fix:**
- Implement responsive breakpoints
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Test on actual devices
- Add mobile-specific touch gestures

---

### Minor UX Issues

#### 6. Logo Click Behavior - Destructive Action ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** `components/Navigation.tsx`
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Dec 2025)

~~**Problem:** Logo click deleted all localStorage data~~

**Resolution:** Replaced destructive onClick handler with simple Next.js Link
```typescript
<Link href="/" className="flex items-center gap-3">
  {/* Simple navigation, no localStorage manipulation */}
</Link>
```

✅ Users can now safely click logo without losing data
✅ Faster navigation using Next.js routing

---

#### 7. Before/After Examples - Limited
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** Homepage, prompts library

**Problems:**
- Limited visual examples on homepage
- No thumbnail previews in prompts library
- Users can't see results before trying

**Impact:** Users hesitant to try features
**Fix:** Add before/after galleries for each prompt category

---

## ⚠️ BACKEND & SECURITY ISSUES

### Critical Security/Performance

#### 8. Rate Limiting - In-Memory Storage 🟡 MOSTLY FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL → Medium
**Location:** `app/api/process-image/rate-limit.ts`, `lib/rateLimitKv.ts`
**Status:** 🟡 Infrastructure built, needs env vars to activate (Dec 2025)

**Resolution:**
✅ Created `lib/rateLimitKv.ts` with Vercel KV-based rate limiting
✅ Added IP-based rate limiting to 5 vulnerable API endpoints
✅ Old in-memory limiter marked as `@deprecated`
✅ Graceful degradation when KV not configured

**Commits:**
- `9d1af4c` - Add backend infrastructure with KV rate limiting
- `ed07a08` - Secure 5 vulnerable API endpoints with IP-based rate limiting
- `e353ee1` - Add IP-based rate limiting to all paid API endpoints

**Remaining:** Set up Vercel KV environment variables to activate:
```bash
# Add to Vercel dashboard or .env.local:
KV_URL=...
KV_REST_API_URL=...
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=...
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=...
```

---

#### 9. Console.log Pollution 🟡 90% CLEANED
**Severity:** High → Low
**Location:** Site-wide
**Status:** 🟡 Mostly cleaned (Dec 2025)

**Original:** 233 console.log statements across 57 files
**Current:** 23 console.logs in 5 files (90% reduction!)

**Remaining locations:**
- `app/batch/page.tsx` - 10 logs
- `app/components/BatchProcessorNSFW.tsx` - 8 logs
- `app/roulette/page.tsx` - 3 logs
- `app/pricing/page.tsx` - 1 log
- `app/roast/page.tsx` - 1 log

**Impact:** Significantly improved. Remaining logs are mostly debug statements in complex features (batch processing, roulette). Low security risk.

**Next step:** Remove remaining 23 logs or wrap in environment check:
```typescript
const log = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? console.log : () => {}
```

---

#### 10. Missing API Key Validation
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** Multiple API routes

**Problems:**
- Some routes lack env variable checks
- Could crash with unclear errors if keys missing
- Inconsistent validation patterns

**Impact:** Poor error messages, debugging difficulty
**Fix:** Create validation middleware:
```typescript
// lib/validateEnv.ts
export function requireEnvVar(key: string): string {
  const value = process.env[key]
  if (!value) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${key}`)
  }
  return value
}

// Usage in API routes
const apiKey = requireEnvVar('GEMINI_API_KEY')
```

---

#### 11. Error Handling Inconsistency
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** API routes

**Problems:**
- Some routes have detailed error messages
- Others return generic "Failed to..." messages
- No error codes for debugging
- Client can't distinguish error types

**Impact:** Poor debugging experience, unclear errors for users
**Fix:** Standardize error responses:
```typescript
// lib/apiErrors.ts
export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    public code: string,
    message: string
  ) {
    super(message)
  }
}

// Usage
throw new ApiError(429, 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED', 'Daily limit reached')
```

---

### Data & Database Issues

#### 12. Prisma + InstantDB Confusion
**Severity:** High
**Location:** Multiple files

**Problem:**
- Using BOTH Prisma (Showcase feature) AND InstantDB (user tracking)
- Two databases for one app = unnecessary complexity
- Prisma uses SQLite in dev (not production-ready per TODO.md line 100)
- Different auth patterns for each system

**Impact:**
- Increased maintenance burden
- Data inconsistency risk
- More API keys to manage
- Confusing codebase

**Fix:** Choose ONE database:

**Option A: Migrate to InstantDB only (Recommended)**
- Already handling auth, images, favorites, usage
- Real-time updates built-in
- No server required
- Simpler architecture

**Option B: Migrate to Prisma + Vercel Postgres**
- More control over schema
- Better for complex queries
- Requires migration from InstantDB

**Recommendation:** Keep InstantDB, migrate Showcase feature to it

---

#### 13. TODO Items in Code
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** `lib/exportFormats.ts`

**Found:**
- Line 137: `// TODO: Integrate real vectorization (potrace, VectorMagic API)`
- Line 186: `// TODO: Integrate jsPDF or similar for real PDF generation`

**Problem:** Placeholder features exposed in UI but not implemented

**Impact:** Users expect features that don't work
**Fix:** Either implement or remove from UI completely

---

## 📊 SEO & METADATA ISSUES

#### 14. Fake Social Proof ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH → Resolved
**Location:** `app/layout.tsx`
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Dec 2025)

~~**Problem:** Fake aggregateRating in structured data violated Google guidelines~~

**Resolution:** Removed all fake rating data from structured data
- Commit: `d0c3f9f` - "Remove fake aggregateRating and sync prompt counts to 272+"
- No more legal/SEO risk from fake reviews
- Clean structured data compliant with Google guidelines

✅ Site now fully compliant with Google's structured data requirements
✅ Legal risk eliminated
✅ Professional, honest representation

**Future:** Consider adding real review integration (Trustpilot, reviews.io) when ready

---

#### 15. OG Image Format - SVG Not Supported ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Medium → Resolved
**Location:** `app/layout.tsx`, `public/`
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Dec 2025)

~~**Problem:** OG image was SVG format, not supported by most social platforms~~

**Resolution:** Converted to PNG and updated all references
- Commit: `8d5a1d2` - "Fix OG image format: SVG to PNG for social media compatibility"
- Created `public/og-image.png` (1200x630px)
- Updated all metadata references to use PNG
- Kept SVG as backup

✅ Social media previews now display correctly on X/Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
✅ Proper 1200x630 dimensions for optimal sharing
✅ Better brand presentation when links are shared

**Current implementation:**
```typescript
images: [{ url: '/og-image.png', width: 1200, height: 630 }]
```

---

#### 16. Missing Google Analytics/Search Console
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** Site-wide

- `Ctrl+V` - Paste image
- `Ctrl+Enter` - Submit transformation
- `Esc` - Close modals
- `←/→` - Navigate history

---

#### 25. Favorite System - LocalStorage Only
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** Prompts library

**Problems:**
- Favorites don't sync across devices
- Lost if user clears browser data
- Already using InstantDB for other data
- Inconsistent with rest of app

**Impact:** Users lose favorites unexpectedly
**Fix:** Migrate to InstantDB (already available in `useImageTracking` hook)

---

## 💡 VIRAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

#### 26. Social Sharing Weak
**Severity:** High
**Location:** `components/ShareModal.tsx`

**Problems:**
- ShareModal exists but not optimized
- No "Created with PicForge" watermark on shares

## 🐛 BUGS TO FIX

#### 30. Metadata Inconsistency ✅ FIXED (Duplicate of #1)
**Severity:** High → Resolved
**Locations:** Multiple files
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Dec 2025)

~~**Problem:** Inconsistent prompt counts across site~~

**Resolution:** Same fix as Issue #1 - all counts synchronized to **272+**
- See Issue #1 for full details
- Commit: `03bb44b` - "Sync all prompt counts to accurate 272+ across codebase"

✅ All mentions now consistently show "272+ prompts"

---

#### 31. Prompt Counter Logic
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** `lib/prompts.ts`

**Problem:**
- Count discrepancies suggest:
  - Missing prompts
  - Wrong categorization
  - Duplicate prompts
  - Calculation error

**Fix:** Run audit script:
```typescript
// scripts/audit-prompts.ts
import { prompts } from '@/lib/prompts'

console.log(`Total prompts: ${prompts.length}`)
console.log(`Categories: ${new Set(prompts.map(p => p.category)).size}`)
console.log(`Unique tags: ${new Set(prompts.flatMap(p => p.tags)).size}`)

// Check for duplicates
const titles = prompts.map(p => p.title)
const duplicates = titles.filter((t, i) => titles.indexOf(t) !== i)
if (duplicates.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Duplicate prompts found:`, duplicates)
}
```

---

#### 32. Environment Variables Exposure Risk
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** 22 files reference `process.env`

**Problem:**
- Some env vars may leak in client-side code
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars should be in client
- Potential security risk

**Impact:** API keys could be exposed
**Fix:** Audit all env usage:
```bash
# Search for process.env in client components
grep -r "process.env" app/ components/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Ensure only NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars in client code
# All API keys should be in API routes only
```
