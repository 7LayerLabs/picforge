**Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Trending score = likes in last 7 days
const sevenDaysAgo = Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)

Ensure example images exist in `/public/examples/`:
- elon.jpg, elon_sketch.png
- sidney.webp, sidney_sketch.png
- derek.jpg, derek_zombie.png, derek_cyberpunk.png
- Additional transformation examples as needed
