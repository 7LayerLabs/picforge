- Accept cookie consent banner
- Disable ad blockers
- Check browser console for errors

### Events not showing in GA4?
- Wait 24-48 hours (processing delay)
- Use DebugView for real-time events
- Verify cookie consent accepted
- Check event names match (case-sensitive)

**Full troubleshooting:** See [GA4_SETUP.md](GA4_SETUP.md#troubleshooting)

## FAQ

**Q: Will this slow down my site?**
A: No. GA4 loads asynchronously after the page is interactive. Cookie banner is lightweight (<5KB). Zero impact on Core Web Vitals.

**Q: Is this GDPR compliant?**
A: Yes. Uses Google Consent Mode v2, requires explicit consent, includes IP anonymization, and provides clear opt-out.

**Q: What if users decline cookies?**
A: GA4 won't load at all. No tracking, no data collection. Their choice is respected and stored in localStorage.

**Q: Can I test this in development?**
A: Yes. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_DEBUG=true` to `.env.local`. But it's disabled by default to avoid polluting production data.

**Q: How long until I see data in GA4?**
A: Real-Time reports: 30 seconds. Regular reports: 24-48 hours. Custom events: 24-48 hours.

**Q: What about user privacy?**
A: We track behavior, not identity. No personal data goes to GA4. Images are processed client-side. IP addresses are anonymized.

**Q: Can I track conversions for Google Ads?**
A: Yes! Mark events as conversions in GA4, then link GA4 to Google Ads for conversion tracking and optimization.

**Q: How much does GA4 cost?**
A: Free for up to 10 million events per month. PicForge will be well under this limit.

## Code Examples

### Fire a custom event

```typescript
import { trackEvent } from '@/lib/analytics';

// Track an image transformation
trackEvent('image_transformation', {
  prompt_category: 'Art Styles',
  prompt_title: 'Van Gogh',
  locked_composition: true,
  is_nsfw: false
});
```

### Check cookie consent

```typescript
const hasConsent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent') === 'accepted';

if (hasConsent) {
  // Load additional tracking
}
```

### Track a conversion

```typescript
import { trackPromoCodeRedemption } from '@/lib/analytics';

trackPromoCodeRedemption({
  code_tier: 'unlimited',
  code_type: 'founder'
});
```
