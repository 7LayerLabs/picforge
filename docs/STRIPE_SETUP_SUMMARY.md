## Current Status

### ✅ What's Complete (95%)

- ✅ Fixed webhook handler using React hooks (`db.useQuery`) instead of admin API (`db.query`)
  - **Issue:** Webhook would fail when trying to query InstantDB
  - **Fix:** Changed to use `db.query()` instead of `db.useQuery()` in API route
  - **File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (lines 12-49, 51-89)

## ⚠️ What Needs Your Action (5%)

### CRITICAL: Webhook Secret is Placeholder

**Current Value:**
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Payments won't grant Pro access automatically
- ❌ Users who pay won't receive their benefits
- ❌ Webhook signature verification will fail
- ❌ Potential security vulnerability

**What You Need to Do:**

1. **Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard** (10 minutes)
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - URL: `https://pic-forge.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_...`)

2. **Update Vercel environment variables** (5 minutes)
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Find `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - Paste the secret from step 1
   - Save and redeploy

3. **Update local .env.local** (2 minutes)
   - Open: `C:\Users\derek\OneDrive\Desktop\nano\.env.local`
   - Line 27: Replace `whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE` with your actual secret
   - Save and restart dev server

**Total Time: 17 minutes**

## How Payment Flow Works

```
User Journey:
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" on /pricing
2. Frontend calls /api/create-checkout-session
3. Backend creates Stripe session with userId in metadata
4. User redirected to Stripe Checkout
5. User enters payment info
6. Stripe processes payment

Webhook Flow (happens automatically):
7. Stripe sends webhook to /api/webhooks/stripe
8. Webhook handler verifies signature (needs valid secret!)
9. Handler extracts userId from metadata
10. Handler updates InstantDB: tier = 'pro'
11. User redirected to /success page
12. User now has unlimited images + no watermark!
```

---

## Revenue Model

**Pricing:**
- Monthly: $14/mo
- Yearly: $119/yr (Save 29% - $9.92/mo effective)

**Profit Margins:**
- Gemini API cost: ~$0.00004/image
- Even at 1,000 images/user/month: $0.04 cost
- Profit per monthly user: $14 - $0.04 = $13.96 (99.7% margin!)

**Target Metrics:**
- 100 monthly users = $1,400/mo MRR
- 100 yearly users = $11,900/yr ARR ($992/mo MRR)
- Mix of 50/50 = ~$1,200/mo MRR

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing (Recommended First)

1. Install Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   scoop install stripe

   # Mac
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   ```

2. Start webhook listener:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3003/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. Copy test webhook secret from output

4. Update .env.local with test secret

5. Go to http://localhost:3003/pricing

6. Click "Upgrade to Pro"

7. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Expiry: 12/25, CVC: 123)

8. Verify user upgraded to Pro tier

**Detailed instructions:** `scripts/test-stripe-webhook.md`

## Production Deployment

### Before Going Live:

- [ ] Webhook endpoint created in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Webhook secret updated in Vercel
- [ ] Webhook secret updated in local .env.local
- [ ] Vercel redeployed with new env vars
- [ ] Test payment completed successfully (use test mode first!)
- [ ] Webhook logs show 200 OK
- [ ] User tier updates correctly
- [ ] Watermark removal works

### Monitoring After Launch:

1. **Webhook Success Rate**
   - Check: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks → Logs
   - Target: >99% success
   - Alert if: <95%

2. **Payment Success Rate**
   - Check: https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
   - Target: >90%
   - Alert if: <80%

3. **User Tier Sync**
   - Check daily: Users with subscriptionId but tier='free'
   - Fix manually if found

## Troubleshooting

### "Webhook returns 401 Unauthorized"
**Fix:** Verify webhook secret matches in both Stripe Dashboard and Vercel. Redeploy after updating.

### "User paid but still shows Free tier"
**Fix:**
1. Check Stripe webhook logs: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Check Vercel function logs: Vercel Dashboard → Logs
3. Manually update tier in InstantDB if needed

### "Watermark still shows after upgrade"
**Fix:**
1. User should refresh page
2. Verify tier = 'pro' in InstantDB
3. Clear browser cache if needed

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required):
1. [ ] Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
2. [ ] Update webhook secret in Vercel
3. [ ] Update webhook secret in local .env.local
4. [ ] Test with Stripe CLI locally
5. [ ] Deploy and test with real payment (small amount)

### Short-term (Recommended):
1. [ ] Set up Stripe Customer Portal for subscription management
2. [ ] Add subscription management link to profile page
3. [ ] Set up email notifications for payment events
4. [ ] Monitor webhook logs for first week

### Long-term (Nice to Have):
1. [ ] Add usage analytics to admin panel (MRR, churn, conversion)
2. [ ] Create cancellation flow with exit survey
3. [ ] Add retention offers for canceling users
4. [ ] Implement annual plan discount campaigns
