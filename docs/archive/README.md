# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical and supplementary documentation that has been archived to keep the main docs directory focused and organized.

## Archive Structure

### `/implementation/`
Contains detailed implementation notes and step-by-step guides that were created during feature development. These files typically have names like `*_IMPLEMENTATION*.md` and provide deep technical context about how features were built.

**Use when:** You need to understand the detailed implementation decisions or step-by-step process that went into building a specific feature.

### `/setup/`
Contains original setup and configuration documentation that has been consolidated into more comprehensive guides. These are kept for historical reference.

**Use when:** You need to see the original setup documentation or understand how configuration evolved over time.

### `/reviews/`
Contains code reviews, audits, and analysis documents. These provide point-in-time assessments of the codebase, security reviews, and architectural decisions.

**Use when:** You want to understand past code quality assessments or see what issues were identified and resolved.

### `/guides/`
Contains feature-specific guides, quick references, and how-to documents that supplement the main documentation.

**Use when:** You need detailed usage instructions for a specific feature or want quick reference materials.

### `/status/`
Contains completion reports, project summaries, and milestone documents that capture the state of the project at various points in time.

**Use when:** You want to understand what was completed, when features were finished, or see historical project status.

## Finding Archived Content

All archived files maintain their original names and content. To find specific information:

1. **Search by feature name:** Most files are named after the feature they document
2. **Search by type:** Use the folder structure to narrow down to implementation notes, reviews, etc.
3. **Check the main docs:** The primary documentation in `/docs` references archived content when relevant

## Why Archive?

Documentation is archived to:
- **Reduce clutter** in the main docs directory
- **Maintain focus** on current, actionable documentation
- **Preserve history** without deleting valuable context
- **Improve discoverability** by organizing by purpose rather than chronology
