3. You: Build it (execution)
4. Social Marketer: "Here are 20 tweets to promote the launch" (distribution)

## **Contest Best Practices**

When designing contests:
- **Low-barrier entry** - Follow, retweet, tag friend (easy actions)
- **Shareable mechanics** - "Tag 3 friends" = natural amplification
- **Platform compliance** - No "like to win" on some platforms
- **Clear value** - Prize must be relevant to audience
- **Limited duration** - 7-14 days (creates urgency)

## **Engagement Tactics**

The agent uses:
- **Questions** - "What's your most chaotic transformation?"
- **Fill-in-the-blank** - "I use PicForge to ___"
- **Polls** - "Which feature next: A, B, C, D?"
- **Challenges** - "Show us your weirdest transformation"
