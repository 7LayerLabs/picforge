## Implementation Order (Recommended)

1. **Prompt Quality Feedback** - Fastest implementation, immediate value
2. **Variant Comparison** - Good UX improvement, moderate complexity
3. **Region-Aware Editing** - Most complex, but highly valuable

## Sources

These features were inspired by analyzing the [NanoBananaEditor](https://github.com/markfulton/NanoBananaEditor) repository and cherry-picking the most valuable features that align with PicForge's simple, prompt-based workflow.

**Note:** We are NOT importing their codebase. These are custom implementations built specifically for PicForge.
