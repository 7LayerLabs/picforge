## Pricing Strategy Rationale

### Free Tier (500 images/day)
**Why this works:**
- Generous enough to show value
- Creates natural upgrade trigger when limit is hit
- Acts as cost control mechanism
- Lower than power users need (content creators, designers)

### Pro Tier ($14/month, $99/year)
**Why this works:**
- **$14/month**: Below Canva Pro ($15.99), competitive with Adobe Express
- **$99/year**: $8.25/month effective - 41% savings incentivizes annual commitment
- **Impulse-buy range**: Low enough for individual purchase decisions
- **Business-friendly**: Easy to expense for small businesses/freelancers

---

## Revenue Projections (Conservative)

### Year 1 Targets
- **User Base**: 30,000 free users by end of year
- **Conversion Rate**: 3% (900 Pro users)
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: $9,000/month
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: $108,000/year

### Profit Margins
- **Cost per Pro user**: ~$8/month (Gemini API + hosting)
- **Revenue per Pro user**: $14/month
- **Gross profit**: $6/month per Pro user (43% margin)

### Break-Even
- **Need**: ~1,000 Pro users
- **Timeline**: Achievable in 12-18 months with current growth trajectory

## Conversion Optimization Tactics Used

### Psychological Triggers
- **Social Proof**: "10,000+ creators" badge, testimonials
- **Scarcity**: "Limited time offer", "Offer ends soon"
- **Urgency**: Fixed bottom-right corner notification
- **Authority**: User testimonials with real roles
- **Anchoring**: Yearly price shows monthly equivalent
- **Loss Aversion**: Free tier shows crossed-out features
- **Reciprocity**: Generous free tier encourages upgrading

### Design Best Practices
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Pro tier stands out with gradient background
- **Color Psychology**: Teal (trust) + Coral (energy) brand colors
- **White Space**: Clean, scannable layout
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive on all devices
- **Clear CTAs**: Prominent upgrade buttons throughout

- Overall free-to-paid: 3-5%

### Revenue Metrics
- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**: Total monthly subscription value

- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Average revenue per customer lifetime
- **Churn Rate**: % of users canceling per month (target: <5%)

### User Behavior
- **Free tier limit hits**: How many users hit 500/day cap
- **Upgrade click-through**: % who click pricing CTAs
- **Trial-to-paid**: If you add trials, track conversion rate
- **Monthly vs Yearly**: Split to optimize discount messaging
