# Unaddressed AI Art Generator Complaints

## Common Issues PicForge Has Not Yet Solved

### 1. Prompt Misinterpretation (Partial Solution Only)
**The Complaint:**
- AI still misunderstands complex or nuanced instructions
- Multi-step prompts often confuse the underlying AI models
- Subtle edits sometimes result in dramatic unwanted changes

**Current Limitations:**
- While we provide templates and a Prompt Wizard, we still rely on the base AI models (Gemini, DALL-E, etc.) which have their own interpretation quirks
- Cannot guarantee the AI will understand context or implied instructions
- No semantic prompt analysis or correction system

---

### 2. Complex Multi-Character Scenes
**The Complaint:**
- Difficulty creating scenes with multiple specific characters
- Cannot control exact positioning of elements
- Struggles with maintaining character consistency across images
- Group compositions often have anatomical errors

**Current Limitations:**
- No advanced composition tools for precise object/character placement
- Cannot maintain character references across different generations
- Limited ability to edit specific parts of complex scenes

### 3. Artistic Originality and Copyright Concerns
**The Complaint:**
- AI models trained on existing artwork without artist consent
- Questions about who owns AI-generated content
- Lack of attribution to original artists whose styles are mimicked
- Ethical concerns about AI replacing human artists

**Current Limitations:**
- We use standard AI models (Gemini, DALL-E, SDXL) trained on internet data
- No attribution or compensation system for original artists
- Terms of Service places all responsibility on users
- No way to verify if generated content infringes on existing copyrights

### 4. Style Consistency Across Sessions
**The Complaint:**
- Cannot save a specific "style" to reuse later
- Each session starts fresh with no memory of previous preferences
- Difficult to maintain brand consistency for business users

**Current Limitations:**
- No user accounts or style profiles
- No style preservation between sessions
- Cannot save custom presets or preferences

---

### 5. Advanced Professional Features
**The Complaint:**
- No layer support like Photoshop
- Cannot do selective edits to specific regions
- No masking tools for precise control
- Missing professional color grading tools

**Current Limitations:**
- Designed as a consumer tool, not professional software
- No advanced selection or masking capabilities
- Limited to whole-image transformations

---

### 6. Offline Functionality
**The Complaint:**
- Requires internet connection for AI features
- Cannot work in areas with poor connectivity
- Concerns about data being sent to external servers

**Current Limitations:**
- AI processing requires API calls to external services
- No offline AI model available
- Images must be processed through third-party services

---

### 7. Training Custom Models
**The Complaint:**
- Cannot train on specific styles or subjects
- No way to create personalized AI models
- Cannot fine-tune for specific use cases

**Current Limitations:**
- No custom model training capability
- Uses only pre-trained models
- Cannot learn user preferences over time

---

### 8. Batch Processing Limitations
**The Complaint:**
- Sequential processing can be slow for large batches
- No distributed processing for faster results
- Limited to predefined effects in batch mode

**Current Limitations:**
- Processes images one at a time
- Cannot apply AI transformations in batch mode (only preset effects)
- No parallel processing infrastructure

---

### 9. Version Control and Collaboration
**The Complaint:**
- No way to share projects with team members
- Cannot track changes or revert to previous versions
- No collaborative editing features

**Current Limitations:**
- Single-user tool with no collaboration features
- No project saving or version history
- No team workspaces or sharing capabilities

---

### 10. Mobile Experience
**The Complaint:**
- No dedicated mobile app
- Web interface not fully optimized for mobile devices
- Difficult to use advanced features on small screens

**Current Limitations:**
- Web-only platform
- Limited mobile responsiveness for complex features
- No native iOS or Android applications

## Summary

These limitations represent areas where PicForge could potentially expand in the future, but currently fall outside the scope of the platform's capabilities. Many of these issues are inherent to current AI technology limitations rather than specific to PicForge's implementation.
