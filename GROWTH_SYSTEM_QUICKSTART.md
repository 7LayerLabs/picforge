# Growth System Quick Start Guide

## For Derek: How to Use Your New Viral Growth Features

### What Was Built

You now have a complete viral showcase system that turns PicForge users into advocates. Here's what's live:

---

## Homepage Changes

**New Section: "See What's Possible"**

Located below the Before/After gallery, you'll see:
- **Featured Transformations** - 6 showcase items in a grid
- **3 Filter Tabs**:
  - "Trending This Week" 🔥 - Smart algorithm picks hot content
  - "Featured" ⭐ - Admin-curated picks (you can feature items)
  - "Recent" 👁️ - Latest submissions

**Social Proof Counter**
- Shows real-time transformation count
- Displays user count
- Updates automatically from InstantDB

---

## Showcase Page Improvements

**Enhanced Tabs** (top of page):
- Trending → Uses advanced algorithm (recency + engagement)
- Most Liked → All-time favorites (changed from "Popular")
- Recent → Last 7 days
- Featured → Admin picks

**Social Proof Header**:
- Real-time stats: transformations / users / showcases
- Eye-catching badges and counters

**Better Like Buttons**:
- Now have colored backgrounds (coral pink)
- Fill with heart icon when liked
- Bounce animation on click
- Toast notifications for feedback

---

## How the Trending Algorithm Works

Your algorithm prioritizes:
1. **Recent engagement** (last 7 days) - 3x weight
2. **Recency boost** (new = higher) - 2x weight
3. **Total likes** (all-time) - 1x weight
4. **View count** (engagement) - 0.5x weight

**Translation**: New content with lots of recent likes shoots to the top. Old content with tons of total likes stays visible but gradually decays.
