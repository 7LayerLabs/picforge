## **What It Can Fetch/Research**

This agent has **READ ONLY** access to your codebase:
- ‚úÖ Read files (analyze existing features)
- ‚úÖ Search code (understand implementation)
- ‚úÖ Review documentation
- ‚ùå Cannot modify code (advisory role only)

## **Output Format**

The agent structures responses as:

1. **Executive Summary** - TLDR for busy entrepreneurs
2. **Detailed Analysis** - Using RICE scores, competitive data
3. **Recommendation** - Clear "Build/Kill/Iterate" with reasoning
4. **Next Steps** - Specific actions to validate or execute
5. **Open Questions** - What needs testing before committing

## **Tone & Style**
- **Direct** - No fluff, gets to the point
- **Data-driven** - Backs claims with logic and examples
- **Opinionated** - Makes calls, doesn't just present options
- **Action-oriented** - Always ends with "Here's what to do next"
- **Realistic** - Acknowledges tradeoffs and constraints

## **Context Awareness**

The agent knows about:
- **Your situation**: Solo founder, 7 kids, limited time
- **PicForge specifics**: 320+ prompts, freemium model, AI costs
- **Tech stack**: Next.js 15, Gemini API, Replicate, Vercel
- **Competition**: Canva, Adobe, Remove.bg, Midjourney

## **Example Sessions**

### Session 1: Feature Ideation
```bash
You: "product-manager: what should we build next for PicForge?"

Agent: Generates 5 RICE-scored feature ideas with:
- Full analysis of each idea
- Prioritized roadmap (what to build when)
- Revenue projections
- Implementation complexity
- Competitive advantages
```

### Session 2: Build/Kill Decision
```bash
You: "should we build a mobile app or focus on web?"

Agent:
- Analyzes market data (80% of image editing is mobile)
- Calculates development effort (3-6 months native app)
- Compares alternatives (iOS shortcuts = 2 weeks)
- Recommends: Build shortcuts first, validate demand, then native app
- Provides RICE scores for each option
```

### Session 3: Pricing Strategy
```bash
You: "how much should we charge for Pro?"

Agent:
- Researches competitor pricing (Canva $13/mo, Remove.bg $9/mo)
- Analyzes your costs (~$0.001-0.023/image)
- Calculates unit economics
- Recommends: $9/mo (aggressive) or $12/mo (market rate)
- Suggests A/B test with 2-week trial
```

## **Best Practices**

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask specific questions ("Should we build X?" not "What should we do?")
- Provide context ("We have 10K users, $5K/mo in costs")
- Challenge the agent's recommendations ("What if we can't afford that?")
- Use for strategic decisions (not tactical code questions)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Ask for code implementation (agent is advisory only)
- Expect it to write features (that's your job or use other agents)
- Use for debugging or bug fixes (wrong agent)
- Ignore the RICE scores (they're data-driven for a reason)

## **Integration with Other Agents**

This agent works well with:
- **ui-design-specialist** - Product says what to build, UI says how it should look
- **social-media-marketer** - Product designs viral features, marketer promotes them

**Example workflow:**
1. Product Manager: "Build Battle Mode feature" (strategy)
2. UI Designer: "Make it look like this" (design)
3. You: Build it (execution)
4. Social Marketer: "Here's how to launch it" (promotion)

## **Model**
- Uses: `claude-sonnet-4-5` (latest Sonnet model)
- Color: `blue` (in UI)
