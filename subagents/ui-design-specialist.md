## **Best Practices**

### ✅ DO:
- Provide URLs for site reviews (not just descriptions)
- Ask for specific recommendations (not vague "make it better")
- Challenge the agent ("Our brand IS corporate, we like blue")
- Request examples ("Show me sites that do this well")

### ❌ DON'T:
- Ask for code implementation (agent doesn't write CSS)
- Expect pixel-perfect mockups (agent describes, doesn't design files)
- Ignore accessibility warnings (contrast ratios matter)
- Follow every trend blindly (brand consistency > trend-chasing)

## **Integration with Other Agents**

Works well with:
- **product-manager** - Product says WHAT to build, UI says HOW it should look
- **social-media-marketer** - UI creates beautiful sites, marketer screenshots them for social

**Example workflow:**
1. Product Manager: "Build Pro subscription page" (what)
2. UI Specialist: "Use coral CTA, bento grid layout, show pricing tiers" (how)
3. You: Build it (execution)
4. Social Marketer: "Here's how to promote it" (distribution)
