# Database Consolidation - Complete

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Issue:** #12 Database Consolidation
**Status:** COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

PicForge has successfully consolidated from a dual-database architecture (Prisma + InstantDB) to a **single InstantDB-only** architecture. All Prisma code, dependencies, and database files have been removed.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Prisma Files & Directories
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - SQLite schema definition
- `prisma/schema.production.prisma` - PostgreSQL schema (deleted Oct 21)
- `prisma/dev.db` - SQLite development database (deleted Oct 21)
- `prisma/dev.db-journal` - SQLite journal file (if existed)
- Entire `prisma/` directory removed

### 2. Prisma Library Code
- `lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client initialization (deleted Oct 21)
- `lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth helper functions using Prisma (deleted Oct 21)
- `lib/auth-options.ts` - NextAuth configuration (deleted Oct 21)

### 3. NextAuth Integration
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth API route (deleted Oct 21)
- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Sign-in page (deleted Oct 21)
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page (deleted Oct 21)
- `app/dashboard/` - Dashboard using NextAuth (deleted Oct 21)
- `types/next-auth.d.ts` - Type definitions (deleted Oct 21)
- `components/UserMenu.tsx` - User menu with NextAuth (deleted Oct 21)

### 4. Deprecated API Routes
- `app/api/showcase/route.ts` - Old Prisma showcase API (deleted Oct 21)
- `app/api/showcase/[id]/like/route.ts` - Old like system (deleted Oct 21)
- `app/api/showcase/featured/route.ts` - Old featured API (deleted Oct 21)

### 5. Dependencies (Removed from package.json)
- `@prisma/client` - Removed during earlier cleanup
- `@auth/prisma-adapter` - Removed during earlier cleanup
- `next-auth` - Removed during earlier cleanup
- `prisma` - Removed during earlier cleanup

### 6. Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - Removed from `.env.local`

### 7. Build Scripts
- `prisma generate` removed from build process
- All `db:*` scripts removed from package.json

## What Data Lives Where (InstantDB Schema)

All data now lives in **InstantDB** (`lib/instantdb.ts`):

### Core User Data
- **users** - User accounts (email, name, createdAt)
- **usage** - Daily usage tracking, tier management, subscription IDs

### Image Data
- **images** - Generated images (prompt, originalUrl, transformedUrl, locked, timestamp)
- **favorites** - User's favorite prompts and images

### Promo & Referral System
- **promoCodes** - Promo code generation and redemption
- **referrals** - Referral tracking and bonus images

### Showcase System
- **showcaseSubmissions** - User-submitted transformations (title, prompt, images, likes, views, featured, approved)
- **showcaseLikes** - Like tracking for showcase items

### Email Preferences
- **emailPreferences** - User notification preferences (welcomeEmails, limitWarnings, weeklyDigests, marketingEmails)

### Roulette Game Features
- **rouletteStreaks** - Daily streak tracking (currentStreak, longestStreak, lastSpinDate, totalSpins)
- **rouletteAchievements** - Achievement unlocks
- **rouletteSpins** - Spin history (category, prompt, images, isRare, shareCount, voteCount)
- **rouletteVotes** - Community voting (creative, funny, chaotic)

## Migration Notes

### October 21, 2025 - Initial Migration
- All showcase functionality migrated from Prisma to InstantDB
- User authentication switched from NextAuth to InstantDB magic links
- Image tracking and favorites migrated
- Promo code system built on InstantDB
- Deprecated API routes marked with 410 Gone status

### October 22, 2025 - Final Cleanup
- Removed remaining Prisma directory and schema file
- Removed DATABASE_URL from environment variables
- Confirmed zero Prisma usage in codebase
- Documentation updated

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Before (Dual Database)
- 2 databases: Prisma (SQLite/PostgreSQL) + InstantDB
- 2 auth systems: NextAuth (disabled) + InstantDB (active)
- ~15 deprecated files
- 4 unused dependencies
- Complex build process with `prisma generate`
- Data sync issues between databases

### After (InstantDB Only)
- 1 database: InstantDB
- 1 auth system: InstantDB magic links
- Clean, simplified codebase
- Smaller node_modules
- Faster builds (no Prisma generation)
- Real-time data sync built-in
- Offline support with automatic sync
- Client-side only (no backend server needed)

## Architecture Impact

### Key Files Using InstantDB
- `lib/instantdb.ts` - Schema and initialization
- `components/AuthButton.tsx` - Magic link authentication
- `hooks/useImageTracking.ts` - Image generation and usage limits
- `hooks/usePromoCode.ts` - Promo code redemption
- `hooks/useShowcaseVotes.ts` - Showcase voting system
- `hooks/useRouletteGame.ts` - Roulette game state
- `hooks/useEmailPreferences.ts` - Email notification settings
- `hooks/useReferral.ts` - Referral tracking
- `app/showcase/page.tsx` - Showcase gallery
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - User profile and stats
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin panel (derek.bobola@gmail.com only)

### No Backend Required
InstantDB handles:
- User authentication (magic links)
- Real-time data queries
- Data persistence
- Offline sync
- Access control
- All database operations

## Verification Steps Completed

1. Searched codebase for Prisma imports - **NONE FOUND**
2. Searched for `@prisma/client` usage - **NONE FOUND**
3. Searched for `PrismaClient` references - **NONE FOUND**
4. Verified InstantDB schema covers all use cases - **CONFIRMED**
5. Removed Prisma directory - **DONE**
6. Removed DATABASE_URL from .env.local - **DONE**
7. Confirmed no Prisma dependencies in package.json - **CONFIRMED**

## Single Source of Truth

**InstantDB is now the single source of truth for all data in PicForge.**

- User accounts and authentication
- Image generation history
- Favorites and prompts
- Usage tracking and tier management
- Promo codes and referrals
- Showcase submissions and votes
- Email preferences
- Roulette game data

## Documentation Updated

- `CLAUDE.md` - Removed all Prisma references, emphasized InstantDB-only
- `DATABASE_CONSOLIDATION.md` - This document
- `PRISMA_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - Archived (cleanup complete)

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise:
1. Prisma code is preserved in git history (before Oct 21)
2. Can revert commits with `git revert`
3. InstantDB data is unaffected and independent
4. All migrations are reversible

However, rollback is **highly unlikely** because:
- Migration completed successfully on Oct 21
- Zero Prisma usage detected in codebase
- All features tested and working
- InstantDB schema is comprehensive

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production for any issues
2. Archive old Prisma-related documentation
3. Consider adding InstantDB schema migration tools for future updates
4. Document InstantDB best practices for the team
