# AI Prompt Assistant - Complete Implementation ✨

## What We Built

A **context-aware, AI-powered chat assistant** that helps users create perfect prompts for image transformations. It's always available, understands what image you're working on, and can insert prompts directly into your editor with one click.

---

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. **Tutorial Popup** (First-Time User Experience)
- **Component**: `components/ChatTutorial.tsx`
- Shows a 4-step interactive tutorial on first chat open
- Explains how to use the assistant
- Progress dots to show tutorial step
- Stores completion in localStorage (won't show again)
- Smooth animations and purple/teal brand colors

### ✅ 2. **Image Context Detection** (Smart Analysis)
- **API Route**: `app/api/analyze-image/route.ts`
- Uses **Gemini Vision** to analyze uploaded images
- Detects:
  - Image type (bedroom, portrait, landscape, food, pet, etc.)
  - Subject (what's in the image)
  - Setting (where it was taken)
  - Mood/vibe
  - Color palette
  - Lighting conditions
  - Current style
  - Transformation suggestions

**How it works:**
1. User uploads image to editor
2. Editor dispatches `imageUploaded` event with base64 data
3. Chat assistant calls `/api/analyze-image`
4. Gemini analyzes the image
5. Chat shows: *"I can see you uploaded a bedroom image! A K-Pop inspired transformation would work great here. What kind of transformation are you thinking?"*

### ✅ 3. **Context-Aware Prompt Enhancement**
- **API Route**: `app/api/enhance-prompt/route.ts` (updated)
- Uses **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for prompt generation
- Accepts image context from Gemini analysis
- Generates 3 optimized prompt variations
- Each prompt is tailored to the actual image uploaded

**Example:**
```
User: "cozy K-Pop bedroom vibe but not too intense"

Context: bedroom, modern, bright lighting, minimalist

AI Response:
"I understand! You want that edgy K-pop aesthetic without going overboard.

Option 1: Modern minimalist bedroom inspired by K-Pop culture — soft pastel
palette (pink, lavender, white), LED strip lighting, framed posters, cozy
bedding, subtle sparkle details, clean Scandinavian furniture, stylish vanity...

Option 2: Korean teen bedroom with subtle edgy elements — monochrome with neon
pops, sleek furniture, anime-inspired art, string lights...

Option 3: [Another variation]"
```

### ✅ 4. **Quick Action Buttons** ("Use This Prompt")
- Each prompt variation has a purple/teal button
- Click to **instantly insert** prompt into active editor
- Dispatches `insertPrompt` custom event
- Shows confirmation: "✓ Prompt inserted! Check your editor."
- Auto-closes chat after 1.5 seconds

### ✅ 5. **Always-Available Chat Widget**
- **Component**: `components/PromptAssistantChat.tsx`
- Floating sparkle button (✨) in bottom-right corner
- Pulse animation to draw attention
- Expands to 400px × 600px chat panel
- Works on ALL pages (integrated in root layout)
- Responsive design (works on mobile)

## How Context Detection Works

### **Flow:**

```
1. User uploads image in editor
   ↓
2. Editor dispatches event:
   window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('imageUploaded', {
     detail: { imageData: base64String }
   }))
   ↓
3. Chat assistant listens for event
   ↓
4. Calls /api/analyze-image with base64 data
   ↓
5. Gemini Vision analyzes image structure
   ↓
6. Returns JSON context:
   {
     type: "bedroom",
     subject: "modern minimalist room",
     setting: "indoor residential",
     mood: "bright and airy",
     colors: ["white", "beige", "natural wood"],
     lighting: "natural daylight through window",
     style: "scandinavian minimalist",
     suggestions: "K-Pop inspired transformations would work great..."
   }
   ↓
7. Chat displays context message
   ↓
8. User asks for prompts
   ↓
9. Claude generates prompts using image context
```

---

## Integration with Editors

### **How to Make Your Editor Listen for Prompts:**

Add this to any editor component (app/editor/page.tsx, app/batch/page.tsx, etc.):

```typescript
'use client'

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function EditorPage() {
  const [customPrompt, setCustomPrompt] = useState('')

  // Listen for prompt insertion from chat
  useEffect(() => {
    const handlePromptInsertion = (event: Event) => {
      const customEvent = event as CustomEvent
      const prompt = customEvent.detail?.prompt

      if (prompt) {
        setCustomPrompt(prompt)
        // Optionally auto-focus the prompt input
      }
    }

    window.addEventListener('insertPrompt', handlePromptInsertion)
    return () => window.removeEventListener('insertPrompt', handlePromptInsertion)
  }, [])

  // Dispatch image upload for context detection
  const handleImageUpload = (imageData: string) => {
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('imageUploaded', {
      detail: { imageData }
    }))
  }

  return (
    // Your editor UI
    <textarea
      value={customPrompt}
      onChange={(e) => setCustomPrompt(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Custom prompt..."
    />
  )
}
```

## Roast Mode Context Detection

**Next Task:** Add image context to Roast Mode for smarter, more targeted roasts.

### **Implementation Plan:**

1. Update `/app/api/roast/route.ts` to accept image context
2. Roast mode calls `/api/analyze-image` when user uploads
3. Pass context to roast generation:
   - "I can see this is a selfie taken in poor lighting..."
   - "This bedroom looks like a tornado hit a Pinterest board..."
   - "Your dog is judging you for this photo quality..."

4. More specific roasts based on actual image content

## Cost Analysis

### **API Usage Costs:**

**Image Analysis (Gemini Vision):**
- Free tier: Generous limits
- Cost after free: ~$0.001 per image analysis
- Example: 1,000 analyses = ~$1

**Prompt Enhancement (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):**
- ~$0.014 per chat message (500 input + 800 output tokens)
- Example: 1,000 chats = ~$14/month

**Total estimated cost for 1,000 users/month:**
- Image analysis: ~$1
- Prompt generation: ~$14
- **Total: ~$15/month**

Very affordable for the value it provides!

## Summary

You now have a **KILLER feature** that sets PicForge apart from every other image tool:

**Before:** User struggles to write good prompts, gets mediocre results, gives up.

**After:** User uploads image → Chat detects it's a bedroom → User says "K-Pop vibe" → Gets 3 perfect prompts → One-click insertion → Amazing results → Becomes a power user.

This is the kind of UX that makes people say *"Holy shit, this is so easy!"* and tell all their friends.

**Next steps:**
1. Add API keys to .env.local
2. Test the chat
3. Integrate with your main editor
4. Add to roast mode
5. Ship it! 🚀
