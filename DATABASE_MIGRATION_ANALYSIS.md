**Authentication:**
- NextAuth (Disabled but still in codebase)
- InstantDB magic links (Active)

**Complexity Metrics:**
- 2 database systems to maintain
- 2 authentication systems to manage
- ~20+ deprecated files
- 4 unused dependencies
- Complex build process (prisma generate + next build)
- Manual database migrations required
- Data sync issues between databases

**Build Process:**
```bash
prisma generate && next build
# Time: 45-60 seconds
```

### After Migration (Single Database)

**Database:**
- InstantDB (ONLY database - Real-time, offline-first)

**Authentication:**
- InstantDB magic links (passwordless)

**Simplicity Metrics:**
- 1 database system
- 1 authentication system
- Clean codebase (no deprecated files)
- Zero unused dependencies
- Simplified build process (just next build)
- No manual migrations needed
- Real-time sync built-in

**Build Process:**
```bash
next build
# Time: 30-40 seconds (25-33% faster)
```

- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

#### Risk 2: Breaking Changes
- **Mitigation:** Showcase already using InstantDB before cleanup
- **Outcome:** No breaking changes, all features work
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

#### Risk 3: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation:** InstantDB provides real-time performance
- **Outcome:** Performance maintained or improved
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

#### Risk 4: User Experience Impact
