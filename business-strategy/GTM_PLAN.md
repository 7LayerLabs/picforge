## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Risks

#### 1. API Cost Explosion üî¥ HIGH RISK

**Risk:** Viral growth outpaces monetization, bankrupting the project

**Impact:** Project shutdown, loss of investment
**Likelihood:** Medium (30% if featured on major platform)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting already in place (500/day)
- [ ] Emergency killswitch to disable free tier
- [ ] Real-time cost monitoring dashboard (alert at $500/day)
- [ ] Aggressive rate limit reduction if costs spike (500‚Üí100/day)
- [ ] Accelerate monetization launch if viral growth occurs
- [ ] Pre-arrange $10K emergency credit line

**Trigger Points:**
- Daily costs exceed $200 for 3 consecutive days
- Free tier usage grows >500% in single week
- Total monthly costs approach $2,000

**Action Plan if triggered:**
1. Immediately reduce free tier to 50/day
2. Launch paid tier within 48 hours (even if not fully ready)
3. Email all users about "unexpected demand" and need to monetize
4. Offer "founding member" discount to convert free users fast

#### 2. Legal Issues with NSFW Content üî¥ HIGH RISK

**Risk:** Users generate illegal content, platform faces liability/bans

**Impact:** Legal action, platform bans (Vercel/Stripe), reputation damage
**Likelihood:** Medium-High (50% over 12 months if NSFW live)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- [ ] Require age verification (credit card or ID scan)
- [ ] Implement content moderation (manual review + AI)
- [ ] Clear Terms of Service (users liable, not platform)
- [ ] No content storage (ephemeral processing only)
- [ ] DMCA takedown process documented
- [ ] Legal review before 18+ launch ($500-1000)
- [ ] Liability insurance ($1,000-2,000/year)

**Prohibited Content (zero tolerance):**
- Child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
- Non-consensual intimate images (revenge porn)
- Extreme violence/gore (snuff content)
- Illegal content in US jurisdiction

**Enforcement:**
- AI-based content scanning (Hive Moderation API)
- User reporting system
- Instant account termination + IP ban
- Cooperation with law enforcement

#### 3. Competitor Copying üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Risk:** Canva/Adobe builds similar features, we lose differentiation

**Impact:** Reduced growth, pricing pressure, harder to compete
**Likelihood:** High (75% within 18 months)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Move fast, innovate constantly (ship weekly)
- Build community loyalty (Discord, showcase, awards)
- Focus on niche use cases (gamification, batch, memes)
- Develop proprietary features (Roast Mode, Roulette)
- Lock in users with saved history/favorites
- Build API ecosystem (harder to replicate)

**Competitive Moat:**
- Brand voice (edgy, fun, anti-corporate)
- Price ($5 vs $13-55/mo)
- Community (user showcase, templates)
- Speed of innovation (weekly releases vs quarterly)

#### 4. AI Provider Changes üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Risk:** Gemini raises prices, changes policies, or shuts down API

**Impact:** Need to migrate providers, potential service interruption
**Likelihood:** Medium (40% over 24 months)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- ‚úÖ Multi-provider architecture already built
- ‚úÖ Fallback to Replicate, OpenAI, Pollinations
- Monitor provider announcements closely
- Test alternative providers quarterly
- Abstract AI calls (easy to swap providers)

**Provider Diversification Plan:**
- Primary: Google Gemini (current)
- Secondary: Replicate SDXL (NSFW only currently)
- Tertiary: OpenAI DALL-E (canvas only currently)
- Backup: Pollinations, Hugging Face, Together AI

### Medium Risks

#### 5. Poor Free‚ÜíPaid Conversion üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Risk:** <1% conversion rate, revenue targets missed

**Impact:** Need to raise prices or cut costs, slower growth
**Likelihood:** Medium (30%)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- A/B test pricing ($4.99 vs $7.99 vs $9.99)
- Add more premium features (high-res, no watermark, etc.)
- Improve paywall UI/messaging
- Test different free tier limits (10 vs 5 vs 3 per day)
- Add time-limited trials ("7 days unlimited free")
- Implement usage nudges ("You've used 8/10 today!")

**Conversion Optimization:**
- Study where users drop off in upgrade flow
- User interviews with power users (why not upgrading?)
- Test value messaging ("Save 10 hours/week")
- Add social proof ("Join 500+ Pro users")

#### 6. High Churn Rate üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Risk:** >15% monthly churn, LTV drops below CAC

**Impact:** Unprofitable customer acquisition, need to reduce spend
**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Improve onboarding (email series, tutorials)
- Add sticky features (saved history, favorites)
- Send usage reports ("You created 50 images this month!")
- Win-back campaigns for churned users
- Exit surveys (understand why canceling)
- Annual plan discount (reduce monthly churn)

**Retention Tactics:**
- Gamification (badges, streaks, leaderboards)
- Community engagement (Discord, showcase)
- Weekly "Template Tuesday" emails
- Early access to new features
- User success stories

### Low Risks

#### 7. Technical Scalability üü¢ LOW RISK

**Risk:** Site crashes under load, poor user experience

**Impact:** Lost users, bad reputation, growth slowdown
**Likelihood:** Low (10% - Vercel handles scaling well)

**Mitigation:**
- ‚úÖ Already on Vercel (auto-scaling)
- ‚úÖ Client-side processing (reduces server load)
- Add CDN/caching if needed
- Monitor performance metrics
- Load testing before major launches
